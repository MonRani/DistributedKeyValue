# Paxos Consensus Algorithm Implementation

## Project Overview

This project implements a distributed key-value store using the Paxos consensus algorithm, ensuring data consistency across distributed nodes using Java RMI communication. The system is built with a multi-threaded architecture where each server runs separate threads for Proposer, Acceptor, and Learner components to handle concurrent operations efficiently.

## Key Features

### 1. Paxos Consensus Algorithm Implementation
- **Complete Paxos Protocol**: Implements the full three-phase Paxos consensus algorithm
  - **Phase 1 (Prepare)**: Proposer sends prepare requests to all acceptors
  - **Phase 2 (Accept)**: Proposer sends accept requests after receiving prepare promises
  - **Phase 3 (Commit)**: Learner commits the value after consensus is reached
- **Quorum-based Consensus**: Requires majority of servers (N/2 + 1) to reach consensus
- **Fault Tolerance**: System continues to function even when some nodes fail
- **Data Consistency**: Ensures all nodes maintain consistent state

### 2. Multi-threaded Architecture
- **Proposer Thread**: Handles proposal generation and consensus coordination
- **Acceptor Thread**: Manages proposal acceptance and voting
- **Learner Thread**: Handles state updates and commit operations
- **Concurrent Operations**: Multiple clients can perform operations simultaneously
- **Thread Safety**: Uses concurrent data structures and atomic operations

### 3. Java RMI Communication
- **Distributed Communication**: Servers communicate using Java RMI
- **Remote Method Invocation**: All consensus operations are performed remotely
- **Network Resilience**: Handles network timeouts and connection failures gracefully
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes requests across available servers

### Key Algorithms

#### Consensus Process
1. **Proposal Generation**: Client request triggers proposal creation
2. **Prepare Phase**: Proposer sends prepare requests to all acceptors
3. **Promise Collection**: Collect promises from majority of acceptors
4. **Accept Phase**: Send accept requests with proposed value
5. **Consensus Check**: Verify majority acceptance
6. **Commit Phase**: Execute operation and update all nodes
